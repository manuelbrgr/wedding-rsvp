### Development and Maintenance

### Information

This website serves exclusively a private, family purpose and is therefore not subject to an imprint obligation. Although, if you have any questions always feel free to reach out through the Contact form. We'll do our best to answer you as soon as we can!

### Media

Most of the pictures you find on this website we found on Unsplash. These photos are made to be used freely. The pictures of the wedding venue are from the website of Tenuta Larnianone. And the pictures of the accommodations nearby that we recommend are from the respective websites.

### Technology

Visit github.com/manuelbrgr for inspiration and to see the source code of the implementation. The frontend is implemented with the React-based open source framework Gatsby, and the backend is running via a serverless architecture in AWS.

### Special Thanks

A special thanks goes to my beloved fiancee Angelika for her restless and amazing help, but also to my dear friend Dominik Braun for introducing, inspiring and convincing me about the power of AWS and Cloud Development.
