    answer: >
      <p>There are plenty of ways to get to Siena - one of them is coming by car, however if you don’t have or don’t want to drive all this way, you can book a flight to one of the following airports and then renting a car or taking a train:</p><br />
      <li>Pisa International Airport (PSA) - 144 km to Siena (1:30h by car / 2h by train)</li>
      <li>Florence International Airport (FLR) - 77 km to Siena (1h by car / 1:40h by train)</li>
      <li>Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport (BLQ) - 168 km to Siena (1:40h by car / 2:30h by train)</li><br />
      <p>Check if from your nearby airport there are <a href="https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en" target="_blank">Ryanair flights</a> so you can save on a flight and you can also check if there’s <a href="https://www.blablacar.co.uk" target="_blank">BlaBlaCar</a> driving to Siena from your arrival city. You can also check our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1435542876905661" target="_blank">Facebook Group</a> for finding a travel buddy or a person to carpool with or ask in our <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ki9UIoFYvB8EY1i9PckzsA" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a> group if anybody has a seat/plans to take the same transportation as you.
