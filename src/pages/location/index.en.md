  descriptionTenuta: >
    Villa Colombaio is an old farmhouse belonging to the Tenuta Larnianone. It’s located in the middle of nature, surrounded by vineyards, olive groves and cypress trees, overlooking the city of Siena. We fell in love with this place not only because it’s beautiful and authentic, but also because it has history. It's belonging to an Italian family since the 1930's who are keeping care of nature, environment and traditions. 🛵
