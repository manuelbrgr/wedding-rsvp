description: >
  There are plenty of accommodations ranging from hotels, Airbnbs, B&Bs and Agriturismos in the area, we are sure you will find something. To make your search easier we looked for some places in the countryside, outside of the city’s center, that are conveniently located for reaching both the wedding venue and the old town, and made a list. If you want to stay in Siena’s center, there are many available options, so feel free to find one that fits your needs best.
information: >
  Some hotels might not be available anymore on Booking.com or other search engines, but it could pay off to just call there and ask. There might be still something available. ☎️ If you come by car and stay inside of Siena or any other bigger city, make sure to pick a hotel that is outside of the ZTL (Zona Traffico Limitato - Limited Traffic Zone) ⛔ or one, that gives you an allowance to enter and park, otherwise you will have to pay a fine. 👮‍♂️ ⚠️

questions:
  - question: How to get from the accommodation to the wedding location? 🚕
    answer: >
      Due to limited parking possibility at the property we are asking and strongly advising to carpool with other guests to and from the wedding, eventually please use local transportation service <a href="https://www.sartinisiena.com/en/" target="_blank">www.sartinisiena.com</a> to arrange a transportation for coming back to your booked accommodations, since Taxis in Siena are not reliable at late night hours.
  - question: Where can I find some accomodation?
    answer: >
      Booking.com or Airbnb.
