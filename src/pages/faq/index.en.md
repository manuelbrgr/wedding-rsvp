questions:
  - question: What's the dress code?
    answer: >
      Knowing what to wear for the wedding is never easy so we defined the wedding dress code as Garden Party - think of something that is pretty but not too formal and at the same time location and event appropriate. Please don't wear jeans or shorts and a t-shirt. The weather should be warm, so light and flowy summer dresses or jumpsuits for women, and light coloured or mixed colour suits for men should be a perfect choice.<br><br>
      Please don’t wear black, white/off-white, or neon colors. If possible go for something inspired by Tuscan landscape or earthy colors (click for inspiration here). Also, bring something to put on in the evening as it might get chilly. Some terrain is uneven, so girls opt for block heels, wedges, sandals or flats, and guys, if you want, feel free to swap your formal dress shoes for loafers if that’s more comfortable. 😄 <br><br>

  - question: When is the RSVP deadline?
    answer: >
      Please RSVP by July 1st, so we can have an accurate headcount. We also understand that unexpected things happen and if that will be the case, please let us know about it as soon as possible. 😄
  - question: Can I bring a date?
    answer: >
      We have a limited capacity and therefore we can only allow people whose names are on the invites. 🥹
  - question: Are kids welcome?
    answer: >
      It’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to have some romantic getaway with your significant other and leave your little ones with their grandparents or you want to come as a family - either way we are happy to have you! We only ask that you pay attention during crucial moments like the ceremony or first dance so that your children don’t interrupt it. 😇
  - question: Where is the wedding? Are all events happening in the same location?
    answer: >
      Both the ceremony and wedding reception will take place in close proximity at the territory of Tenuta Larnianone. Ceremony will be in the garden of Villa Ca’ Nova Sud and the wedding reception in the backyard garden of Villa Colombaio. After midnight the party moves indoors. 💃
  - question: Why do we have to move indoors after midnight?
    answer: >
      We will be having neighbors in the villas around, so in order to respect them and be able to continue the party we have to move indoors. If you have to go out after midnight to get some air, smoke or talk, please try to use the front garden and keep the volume of your talk low. If we don't comply with these rules the party will be stopped by the villa owners. 🔈
  - question: Is it okay to take pictures with phones and cameras? Can I post pictures and stories on Social Media?
    answer: >
      We will have a professional photo+video team at our wedding so <b>we kindly ask you not to take pictures or film during the ceremony</b>.🚫&nbsp; We want you to live with us fully through the moment in real life and time and not through the screen, especially after all the online weddings in 2020. It’s important for us to see and memorize your faces and looks while we are walking down the aisle. We really don’t want to have your face covered by a smartphone in the pictures from our team, as we want to look at these pictures in 10, 20, 50 years time and see your smiles, tears and all the emotions. 📵&nbsp; After the ceremony - during the aperitivo and wedding reception feel free to take your phones or cameras out and take pictures, record videos,  and post stuff online. If you share anything on Social Media, please tag us. 📷
  - question: How do I get to the Tenuta Larnianone?
    answer: >
      Depending where you stay, you can come on foot, by car or by self-organized transportation. Since we have a limited parking opportunity (around 10 cars can fit), please try to carpool with somebody or organize outside transportation. Since there’s no Uber in Siena and Taxi service is not the most reliable, especially at late night hours, we strongly suggest you contact a service, for example Sartini Siena, to set up a drive both to and from the party.
  - question: What about gifts?
    answer: >
      We're so grateful that you are traveling to Italy to celebrate with us. Your presence is the only present we need. 💝
  - question: Will there be an event the day before or after the wedding?
    answer: >
      We are not planning any official events around the wedding day, however, in the days around the wedding, there can always be people who will ask if somebody wants to join some activity like horseback riding + wine tasting so keep checking our facebook group and keep the Whatsapp notifications active. 🎉
  - question: Wanna get to know others before the wedding?
    answer: >
      Awesome! Then join our especially created Whatsapp (contact us to be added) or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1435542876905661" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>! You can get to know other guests, organize carpooling/book a transportation together as a bigger group, rent an accommodation together, find a travel buddy or simply share your questions, messages and pictures there. 😄
  - question: Can I stay at the Villa?
    answer: >
      Currently, the villas have been filled but if you need help with finding accommodation, reach out to us and we will try to help you. 🏡
  - question: Where should I look for accommodations?
    answer: >
      Several accommodations, ranging from hotels, Airbnbs, and B&Bs, Agriturismos, can be found within a 30-minute drive from our venue, in the neighboring villages or Siena. Please see our <a href="/en/accommodation">Accommodation</a> page for more details. 🛏️
  - question: What’s the best way to get to Siena?
    answer: >
      There are a few ways and they all depend on your transportation choice. If you don’t come all the way by car, we suggest flying to one of these airports (check out if you have a cheap Ryanair connection!) Florence, Bologna or Pisa and from there either rent a car (opt for a smaller one - italian streets, especially in the countryside and inside the cities are really tight!) or take a train or a bus to Siena. If you have time or planned vacation around our wedding, you can look for our recommendations for a trip here. 🚗
  - question: Is the wedding indoors or outdoors?
    answer: >
      If the weather allows, our wedding ceremony, aperitif and reception are outdoors, in case of rain we will move to an outdoor tent with a dancefloor inside the villa. ☀️
  - question: What’s the weather like in Siena in September?
    answer: >
      We are hoping for a rain-free and warm day. Historically, the weather in Siena mid-September is lovely and reliable, with the average minimum temperature being 14.2°C and the average maximum daytime temperature lying around 23.5°C. It rains on average a total of 5 days with an average of 57mm. We advise putting on sunscreen for our outdoor wedding. 🌡️
  - question: Whom can I contact with questions?
    answer: >
      Most of the questions should be answered on our website, however if you have problems/questions that you can’t find the answers to here, feel free to ask on Whatsapp (contact us to be added) or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1435542876905661" target="_blank"> Facebook</a> group or contact us directly. Due to intensive wedding preparations and travel we will have limited possibilities to answer from 05.09.2022, in that case please contact Arthur Chimeno (DE, EN) or Zuzanna Lech (EN, PL). 🤙
  - question: What should I keep in mind when traveling to Italy?
    answer: >
      Many hotels have Italian electricity outlets so bring an adapter. Bring sunscreen and mosquito repellant. You can drive with 0,5‰ but please be responsible and don’t risk driving if you feel not fit. Don’t order pizza with pineapple. 🤌
