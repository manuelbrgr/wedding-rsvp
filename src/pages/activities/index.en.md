    name: Explore Siena
    description: Siena is a city that will take your breath away for two reasons, one, it’s really beautiful and two, it’s a city located on a hill, so getting places is a great cardio. Go to Osteria Permalico for delicious local food or if you want to try a Michelin Star awarded restaurant, try La Taverna di San Giuseppe, book a table in advance. 🏛️
  - img: /img/activities/vespa.jpg
    name: Rent a Vespa
    description: A great way to get places and discover the surrounding area is renting a Vespa and just strolling through those tuscan rolling hills on a sunny day, just like in a movie. The countryside roads are very relaxed and provide unlimited pretty views on the way. You can also enjoy a glass of wine or two, since in Italy it’s legal to drive with 0,5‰ but please, drink responsibly and stay safe. 🛵
  - img: /img/activities/winetasting.jpg
    name: Make a wine tour
    description: Tuscany is famous for their red wines, so if you want to taste what they do best, focus on red wines from the area. Having all these vineyards almost every few minutes you find a farmhouse that offers wine tasting. You can do it while hiking, renting a bike or an e-bike or while riding a horse. You can also ask others, if they want to join and have a fun group wine tasting. 🍷
  - img: /img/activities/bicycle.jpg
    name: Get a bike or even an e-bike
    description: There’s nothing better than experiencing Tuscany the old style way while also doing some sport! Especially before or after all the food and wine. Last year we really enjoyed a 50km ride on the e-bikes through paths that we probably wouldn’t go through if we had driven by a car. And if you’re not sure if you can make it with a normal bike, get an e-bike, we did it too and it was a leg-saver! 🚲
  - img: /img/activities/horses.jpg
    name: Ride into the sunset
    description: There’s something special when you’re in the countryside, get up on a horse and casually ride through unpaved roads, surrounded by vineyards, with sun shining down on you and wind blowing through your hair. It feels like traveling back in time, being a lone ranger, looking for a tavern with some wine to drink and a bed to sleep just to continue your journey on the next day. 🐴

    name: Definitely visit Florence
    description: Visit the birthplace of Leonardo da Vinci and the Italian Renaissance. Have one of the best pizzas at Il Pizzaiuolo or a beautiful night at Trattoria Zà Zà. If you want to try the famous Fiorentina Steak then Trattoria Dall'Oste is the place to go. We've always stayed at the My Forte Relais when visiting Florence. 🥩
  - img: /img/activities/sangimignano.jpg
    name: Stop by in San Gimignano
    description: Discover this medieval town with the most towers in Italy and try world famous Gelato at Gelateria Dondoli. When you go to a restaurant, try Vernaccia di San Gimignano, a type of local wine that is the region’s symbol. For a relaxing overnight stay on a farm, outside of the city, we can recommend Agriturismo La Lucciolaia with great views, home cooked food and delicious own wine. 🍦
  - img: /img/activities/gladiator.jpg
    name: Don't miss the beautiful Val d'Orcia
    description: Travel further south to visit Pienza, which is located in the heart of the Val d’Orcia. You can visit the home of Maximus Decimus Meridius from the movie Gladiator. Enjoy a home-cooked meal at La Buca di Enea, one of our favorite restaurants that serves hand rolled pici pasta and wild boar ragù. 🍝
