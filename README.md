# Wedding in Tuscany!

Hi! I built this website for our wedding which was on **10th of September 2022**. Guests could find all the information about our wedding in Siena with tips and recommendations for activities and accomodations. The site was built **multilingual** for our polish, german and english speaking guests. Also, the website provided a **contact form** and an **RSVP form** for guests to submit their attendance and food preferences.

The site is still publicly accessible through [wedding.brgr.rocks](https://wedding.brgr.rocks).

## Frontend

The website was built with **React using Gatsby**, and is hosted as a **Static Site on AWS**. For translations, **i18next** was used. **React Bootstrap** provides pre-built components, and **Jest** is used for **unit testing**.

## Backend

The RSVP and Contact Form is running on AWS, using **API Gateway**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **Amazon SES**. Using **Serverless Framework**, the **infrastructure** is provisioned **through code** (Cloud Formation).
